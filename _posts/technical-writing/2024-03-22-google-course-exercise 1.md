Jane and David are similar to you. They are about the same age as you and have about the same educational level and work experience as you. However, Jane and David differ from you in one very important way:
Jane and David have never seen toothbrushes or toothpaste.  
In fact, Jane and David have never seen brushes or tubes of any kind.  

**Write instructions telling Jane or David how to get toothpaste on a toothbrush.**

**Improve the following sentences. Feel free to rearrange, add, delete, or modify words as you see fit.**

1. JavaScript, despite the similarity in name to Java, has nothing to do with Java and has more to do with marketing, meaning that the inventors of JavaScript wanted to capitalize on the popularity of the earlier language.

   > **JavaScript was named for marketing reason after the language "Java" became popular. The name—JavaScript—actually has nothing to do with Java.** 

2. It is important to keep in mind that the career of Katherine Johnson was able to span both the manual calculation era and the time of computer-based computations.
  
   > **Note: Katherine Johnson worked through both the era of human-based and computer-based computations.**

3. Python, which was invented by Guido van Rossum from the Netherlands in 1991, is a language whose primary data type is the list (like Lisp) and that emphasizes readability based on indentation (like FORTRAN).

   > **Python is a language invented by Guido van Rossum from the Netherlands in 1991. It presents two main features:**
   >  * **Use list as primary data type (like Lisp)**
   >  * **Easy to read with indentation (like FORTRAN)**

Jun and Arash are recent engineering school graduates who have just joined your engineering team. In the past, new engineers on your team have not run sufficient internal tests before releasing new products. New engineers on your team usually don't know what the term dogfooding means.

**Revise the following paragraph for Jun and Arash:**

There are several intended primary goals for dogfooding a new project. At the current time, it is suggested by Engineering that all projects be in dogfood for a period of no less than one month. One is to find bugs under heavy, high-cycle usage. When disastrous bugs occurred in 153 out of 157 of the previous project releases, Engineering's analysis of bugs in the aftermath concluded that prevention of the bugs could have happened by more thorough testing.

>It is suggested that dogfooding, which means running internal tests before releasing new products, should be carried out in all projects for at least more than one month. This is because when disastrous bugs occurred in 153 out of 157 of the previous project releases, Engineering's analysis of bugs in the aftermath concluded that prevention of the bugs could have happened by more thorough testing. Therefore, the primary goal for dogfooding a new project is to find bugs under heavy, high-cycle usage.
