Here is a list of online technical writing courses and learning materials I have studied with my personal reviews attached. Most of the resources here are in English, though some are aimed at Chinese speakers.    
The list is still under development, and hopefully will be useful to anyone who is embarking on the career of technical writing just like me.


# **Technical writing courses**


## 1. [Google Technical Writing Courses for developers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/for-instructors)  

   **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
   These Google courses are suitable for a complete beginner of technical writing, as they cover the basics and intermediate 
   topics in 
   technical writing. Google provides these online courses in two forms:  
   - a variety of self-paced pre-class and in-class materials
   - virtual live sessions
     
   **Highlights:**  
   The pre-class and in-class materials are freely available for anyone (even if you are not attending the live sessions). These 
   materials consist of detailed instructions and exercises related to some use of English grammar, punctuation, organization of 
   paragraph, skills in editing, illustrating and so on. In pre-class materials, possible answers to exercises are given, but no 
   answers to the in-class exercises. Therefore, I posted here some of my answers to in-class exercises for reference if you are 
   interested.   

   **Limitations:**   
   As the virtual live sessions are usually provided once a month and the schedule for next sessions are only given one month 
   ahead (sometimes with no updates at all), the sessions are not as freely available as the pre-class and in-class materials. 
   So I haven't found the chance to attend these sessions, but feel free to check out the sessions yourself.         
    
## 2. [Coursera: Introduction to Technical Writing](https://www.coursera.org/programs/learning-program-for-family-iwira/learn/technical-writing-introduction?source=search)

   **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐  
   This is another course suitable for complete beginners to upgrade their skills in technical writing. It consists of four 
   modules:

     * Fundamentals of Technical Writing
     * Design Principles and Essential Writing Tools
     * Diverse Technical Document Types and Ethical Practices
     * Advanced Topics and Career Advancement

   **Highlights:**  
   The course offers an overview of the principles, common document types, writing and illustrating tools, and some of the best 
   practices in technical writing. Personally, the second and the fourth module have been more useful to me, as they include 
   some practical advice in document design, creating a strong technical writing portfolio, and self-directed learning.
   
   **Limitations:**       
   The course only scratches the surface of technical writing, and it is more theory-based without giving many hands-on 
   exercises. So, this course may not be very informative for people who already have some knowledge of this field or for those 
   who are seeking to enhance their skills in a real-world situation, such as producing a certain type of technical document 
   with the help of a specific writing tool.
