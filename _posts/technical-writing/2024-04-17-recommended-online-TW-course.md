Here is a list of online technical writing courses and learning materials I have studied with my personal reviews attached. Most of the resources here are in English, though some are aimed at Chinese speakers.    
The list is still under development, and hopefully will be useful to anyone who is embarking on the career of technical writing just like me.


**Technical writing courses**


1.[Google Technical Writing Courses for developers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/for-instructors)  

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
These courses are suitable for a complete beginner of technical writing, as they cover the basics and intermediate topics in technical writing. Google provides these online courses in two forms:  
   - a variety of self-paced pre-class and in-class materials
   - virtual live sessions
     
**Highlights:**  
The pre-class and in-class materials are freely available for anyone (even if you are not attending the live sessions). These materials consist of instructions and exercises related to some use of English grammar, punctuation, organization of paragraph, skills in editing, illustrating and so on. In pre-class materials, possible answers to exercises are given, but no answers to the in-class exercises. Therefore, I posted here some of my answers to in-class exercises for reference if you are interested.   

>[!NOTE]  
As the virtual live sessions are usually provided once a month and the schedule for next sessions are only given one month ahead (sometimes with no updates at all), I haven't found the chance to attend these sessions, but feel free to check out the sessions yourself.
