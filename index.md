#**About me**
* * *
As an English teacher with 7 year + teaching experience in different training schools and agencies, I'm currently seeking to make a career change in technical writing. With the help of the Internet, I have been able to access a variety of fascnitating online resources and lessons to make my way into the realm of technical communication. In order to document my learning process as well as practice my technical writing skill, I decided to present in this website some of my learning output and materials which I find extremely useful as a novice technical writer. 

Meanwhile, you can find other resources
